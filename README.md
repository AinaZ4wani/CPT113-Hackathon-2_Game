## Game Description
**_'Chain It Long!'_** is a 3-player game where it starts off with one player that needs to come up with a word, existing in the English dictionary, from a randomly assigned letter in the game. 

Then, the next player will have to create another word from the last letter of the previous player.

There will be 3 rounds in the game. At the end of the game, the amount of words that the player entered and the length of the words will be taken into account to determine the winner. 

If you are able to come up with more words and the longer they are, then YOU are the WINNER!! So, put on your thinking caps, turn your brain gears on, and create words!

## Game Features

1. Simple rules to follow.
2. No time limit.
3. A multiplayer game.
4. Each players get to see other's list of words, so they can prepare beforehand to win the game.

## Game Rules

1. The three players key in their name.
2. Once, the game starts, a random letter is generated by the game.
3. Player 1 will have to create a word from the given letter.
4. Now, it's Player 2's turn, he/she will have to create a word from the last letter of Player 1's word.
5. Player 3 will then repeat step 4.
6. Step 3-5 is repeated until 3 rounds are done.
7. The game will then calculate each players' scores.
8. The more words created by a player and the longer they are, the higher a player's score.

## Object-Oriented Concepts
1. Classes --> The blueprint or template for game objects is defined by classes. In this instance, our programme contains the class called `DynamicQueue` that stores the words keyed in by the players.

2. Structure --> To create new nodes for the Queue, namely `QueueNode`.

3. Objects --> Classes have instances that are objects. The objects of our class `iQueue1`, `iQueue2`, and `iQueue3` to represent player 1, player 2, and player 3 respectively. 

## Usage of Linked Lists/Stacks/Queues
In 'Chain It Long', Queue is being used as our core concept.

`DynamicQueue` has several protected member functions, which are:

1. `enqueue()` --> store the words input by the players in the queue.
2. `dequeue()` --> dequeue and retrieve all the words in the queue.
3. `isEmpty()` --> function to check whether the queue is empty or not.
4. `clear()` --> clears all the elements in the queue.
5. `DynamicQueue()` --> Constructor to create an empty queue.
6. `~DynamicQueue()` --> Destructor to destroy the queue after operations.

## Game Constraints
1. No English words dictionary for validation --> unable to verify if the word input by the player is valid.
